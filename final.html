		<p id= "para">If a non-native aquatic plant is introduced into a new environment, there is a potential for ecological and environmental harm to the native landscape. When gone unchecked, this can entirely destroy a biome from the bottom up, and eradication of the plant can be nearly impossible. <br><br>

		By educating ourselves on how to spot and report an invasive plant species, we can prevent future outbreaks and keep our native populations and beautiful landscape thriving.</p>
